Ideas

* Firmament, with a few stars at least
* Snow: render some fuzzy tiny specs only in-view, de-allocate when they disappear. Maybe give a bit of Brownian motion.
* The game:
  * They merge when they touch
  * You have infinite thrust, infinite fuel and can thrust fore and aft
  * You can _nudge_ anything with one unit. You have a 10 nudge capacity that is replenished one nudge every 3 seconds
  * If you strike a ball, you reflect
  * You get "ownership" of anything you nudge
  * Ownership is contagious:
    * If a thing you own contacts an unowned thing, you get ownership of unowned thing
    * if a thing you own contacts a thing owned by ANOTHER PLAYER, ownership is determined by mass (more massive body gets total ownership.)
